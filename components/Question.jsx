                    Organic SEO is getting your website to the top of Google
                    either in the Maps or at the top of search results. This
                    means you will then get free traffic coming to your website
                    every month. Google Adwords can be expensive and only around
                    10% of people click on them, the other 90% click on an
                    organic search result, so it is good to be there.

                    Our Pricing mostly depend upon difficulty of the keywords
                    and efforts required to rank them on front page of Google.
                    There is a lot of work involved in doing SEO, So our Monthly
                    SEO packages start from 10,000 INR per month. However, at
                    this price, it will take a lot longer to rank at the top of
                    Google. For most businesses, we recommend our 15,000 -25,000
                    INR per month package as it has the best value.

                    <b>An understanding of the Big Picture:</b> A right SEO
                    specialist will see the big picture. Know in detail what
                    needs to be done to get a higher ranking in Google. Because

                    good SEO specialist makes the right decisions and knows how
                    to achieve the fastest outcomes.
